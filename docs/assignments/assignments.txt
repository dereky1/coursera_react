the goal of assignment 1 was to separate the onclick rendering from the menu render. we had to create a new component that imported the menu so our components will be modular. screenshots of end results are named after assignment_1


the goal of assignment 2 was to integrate the about us page into our react app by including its component into our navigation. we also had to import the leaders JSON data into a media table that displayed the information. screenshots are named after assignment_2.

the goal of assignment 3 was to create a button in the menu details section for the user to add comments. we created the button to trigger a modal to allow for user input. the fields in the modal check for verification of correct input. screenshots are named after assignment_3.
